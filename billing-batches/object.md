# Billing Batches
## Overview
Billing batches contain business information and financial details that are essential for subsequent reconciliation and other billing operations. Such batches can be generated by different actors of the supply chain (i.e., Vendors, Distributors and Resellers) and passed to business partners or customers.

The system allows creating billing batches only in case their corresponding billing stream is assigned to the *Active* mode. Note that billing batches can be created only for *simple* billing streams. Otherwise, the system does not allow generating new billing batches or share them with your business partner. 

## Additional Information

# Batch Publication Failure
## Description
In case your input billing data processing returns an error, the system tranfers your batch object to the *Failed* state. Thus, the system will display error messages under *output data* via the **Billing Batch Details** interface and enables to re-upload your spreadsheet file. 

Note that the system also provides an example file that helps learn about the expected file structure.

## Prerequisites

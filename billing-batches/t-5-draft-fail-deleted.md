# Batch Removal
## Description
This transition indicates that your billing batch is removed by the system and cannot be restored. Note that it is possible to delete your batch object only in case it is assigned either to the *Draft* or *Failed* state. Otherwise, your batch cannot be removed. 

Note that in case your billing stream is terminated, the system does not automatically removes its associated billing batches. Thus, in case it is required to remove batches, make sure to delete them before sharing them with your business partners or customers. 

## Prerequisites
Billing batch with the [Draft](s-a-draft.html) or [Failed](s-d-failed.html) status.

## Operation results
Deleted billing batch.

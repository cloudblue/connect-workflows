# Token Deactivation
## Description
This transition implies that operators disabled their token on the CloudBlue Connect platform. Thus, this token is assigned to the *Inactive* state. Furthermore, this token cannot be used for any operations through API. If an inactive token is used for such operations, the system will return a corresponding error. 
## Prerequisites
A token object with the [Active](s-b-active.html) status is required.
## Operation results
A token object in the [Inactive](s-c-inactive.html) state.

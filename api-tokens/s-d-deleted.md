# Deleted Status 
## Description
The *Deleted* status, as the name implies, is displayed in case operators removed their token. Therefore, this token cannot be used for any operations with API. Note that *Deleted* status represents a terminal state. However, the system allows reviewing creation date, assigned permissions and other general object data of your deleted tokens.
## Prerequisites
A token object in the [Active](s-b-active.html), [Inactive](s-c-inactive.html) , or [Pending](s-a-pending.html) state.

# Token Objects
## Overview
Tokens represent objects on the CloudBlue Connect platform that are generated by platform users for various operations and implementing integrations through API. Namely, a token object contains *API Key/Handle* that allows applications to bypass the authorization and access the required API.  
It is highly important to note that token objects are assigned to module permissions on Connect. Such permissions can be disabled or enabled for each individual module on the platform. Thus, for example, in case your application tries to access a module with disabled permissions, it will return the corresponding error.  
Token objects can also be assigned to different extensions that are provided by the Connect platform. However, the workflow of such tokens remains the same.

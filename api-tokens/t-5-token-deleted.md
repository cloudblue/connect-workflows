# Token Removal
## Description
This transition implies that operators decided to delete their token object. As a result, the system assigns the *Deleted* status to this token and it cannot be used for any operations through API. Note, however, that the system allows reviewing general object information of your deleted tokens.
## Prerequisites
A token in the [Active](s-b-active.html), [Inactive](s-c-inactive.html) , or [Pending](s-a-pending.html) state.
## Operation results
A deleted token object.

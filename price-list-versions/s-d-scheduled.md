# Scheduled Status 
## Description
In case your price list version activation is assigned to your specified time and date, the system assigns the *Scheduled* status to your version object. Therefore, your price list version will be activated automatically by the system according to your provided schedule.

If the scheduled activation is no longer required for your price list version, the system allows unscheduling the version activation.
## Prerequisites
A price list version object in the [Draft](s-b-draft.html) state.

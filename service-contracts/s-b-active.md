# Active Status 
## Description
In case a Reseller signes a service contract, the system assigns the *Active* status to this contract. 
Note that Distributors can terminate active service contracts and transfer them to the corresponding state.
Active service contracts allow Resellers to activate the Reseller Portal and address the functionality of the CloudBlue Connect platform. Refer to the [Connect community page](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/partners/contracts/service-contracts/) for more details.
## Prerequisites
A service contract with the [Pending](s-a-pending.html) status.
## Transferable statuses
Once a Distributor terminates an active service contract, the system assigns the [Terminated](s-d-terminated.html) status to this contract.

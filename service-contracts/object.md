# Service Contracts
## Overview
Service contracts are created by Distributors to invite Resellers into the CloudBlue Connect platform. Thus, signed service contracts enable Distributors to collaborate with Resellers and consequently create *syndication contracts*. Furthermore, by signing a service contract, Resellers can activate their Reseller Portal on the Connect platform. Alternatively, Distributors can generate service agreements and service contracts during the Reseller-type Partner account creation.
Once a new service contract is created by a Distributor, the system transfers this contract to the *Pending* state until it is signed and *activated* by a Reseller. Note that Distributors can delete a pending service contract. Therefore, the system removes the deleted contract from the database. Distributors can also terminate active contracts. In contrast, Connect stores *terminated* contracts and enables users to view the contract data.

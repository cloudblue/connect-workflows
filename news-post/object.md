# News Post
## Overview
News posts represent objects that generally include announcements or updates for your business partners on the CloudBlue Connect platform. Such posts can also include cover images and can also have different attachments such as links to your pictures, videos, and so on.    
Your posts can be published and be visible for all of your business partners and your account users or can only be visible to your account users, Vendors, Distributors, or Resellers. Each post can also have an external identifier for your system and can be anonymous if necessary.  
Note that certain user groups can be restricted from viewing posts by excluding corresponding permissions via the Account module.

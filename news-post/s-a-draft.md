# Draft Status
## Description
Once your new post is created and saved on the Connect platform, the system assigns the *Draft* status to this post. Therefore, this status indicates that your post is saved within the system and available for the following edits or publication. The *Draft* status is also assigned to your unpiblished posts. The system allows editing your draft posts and deleting such posts.  
## Prerequisites 
A new saved post or an unpublished post is required.
## Transferable statuses
In case your draft post is published, the system assigns the [Published](s-b-published.html) status to your post.
Draft posts can also be removed if necessary.

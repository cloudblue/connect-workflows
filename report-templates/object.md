# Report Template
## Overview
Report templates define the structure and the content of your generated report files on the CloudBlue Connect platform. The system provides default templates that cannot be disabled or removed. However, Connect allows adding repositories that include custom report templates. Therefore, uploaded report templates can be disabled, blocked, and removed.

Once a new template is added, the system assigns the *Enabled* status to it. Enabled report templates can be assigned to the *Disabled* status and consequently can be hidden from users. Disabled report templates can be enabled again if necessary.

If your repository object is updated and the system cannot locate added templates, your repository will be assigned to the *Failed* status. Thus, the system transfers enabled and disabled templates to the *Blocked* state. Furthermore, in case failed repository is removed, the Connect platform removes all report templates that are associated with this repository.

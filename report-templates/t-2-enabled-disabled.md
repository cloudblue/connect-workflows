# Template Deactivation
## Description
This transition implies that your report template is disabled and hidden from your account users. Thus, this template cannot be used to generate reports on the CloudBlue Connect platform. The system also transfers this template to the *Disabled* state. 
Note that Connect prompts you to provide a note before disabling your report template.
## Prerequisites
Report template in the [Enabled](s-a-enabled.html) state.
## Operation results
Report template with the [Disabled](s-b-disabled.html) status.

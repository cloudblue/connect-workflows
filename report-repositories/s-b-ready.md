# Ready Status
## Description
The *Ready* status implies that the system successfully processed your added report repository. Therefore, your custom report templates should be available within the **Templates** tab (the **Reports** section of the **Accounts** module). Uploaded reports can be used to generate custom reports on the Connect platform.
Note that the system allows users to update repository object details, such as your specified URL and selected tag.
## Prerequisites 
Report repository object in the [Configuring](s-a-configuring.html) state.
## Transferable statuses
In case any of specified repository details are updated or edited, the system assigns the [Configuring](s-a-configuring.html) status to your repository object.
## Associated transitions

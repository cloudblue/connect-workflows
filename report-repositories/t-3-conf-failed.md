# Repository Processing Failure
## Description
This transition implies that the system fails to process your added repository. Thus, your generated report repository object is assigned to the *Failed* status. In general, this transition occurs if your added repository and tag does not return valid report templates.
Note that the system allows editing your provided repository URL and your specified tag in order to process your repository object once again. Furthermore, you can delete failed repository objects if necessary.
## Prerequisites
Report repository object in the [Configuring](s-a-configuring.html) state.
## Operation results
Report repository object with the [Failed](s-c-failed.html) status.

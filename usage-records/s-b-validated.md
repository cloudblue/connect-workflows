# Validated Status
## Description
The *Validated* status, as its name suggests, indicates that your usage record is successfully processed and validated by the system. Therefore, the system allows submitting usage file object to Distributors or Resellers via the Usage module on the Connect platform. 

Once Vendors submit their usage report file to their business partners, the system assigns the *Pending* status to associated usage records. 
## Prerequisites 
A usage record in the [Uploaded](s-a-uploaded.html) state is required.
## Transferable statuses
The system assigns the [Pending](s-d-pending.html) status to validated usage records, in case Vendors submit their usage report file to Distributors or Resellers.

# Closed Status 
## Description
The *Closed* usage record status indicates that Distributors and Resellers successfully accomplished all required billing operations. Furthermore, the system assigns your usage record objects to this state in case Distributor or Reseller systems added **external billing id** and **external billing note** data to this record. 
In case such data is not provided, usage record object cannot be assigned to the *Closed* status.
## Prerequisites
*External billing id* and *external billing note* information should be added to the usage record object with the [Accepted](s-f-accepted.html) status.

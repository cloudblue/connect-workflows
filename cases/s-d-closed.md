# Closed Status
## Description
The Connect platform can automatically assign the *Closed* status to resolved Cases depending on your specified [Autoclose Timeout](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/account/single-sign-on/azure-active-directory/) setting within the **Account** module. 
Otherwise, the issue reporters transfer their resolved Cases to the *Closed* state manually. Therefore, the system prompts issue reports to rate the resolution and provide their feedback.
Note that closed Cases cannot be reopened or assigned to any other state. However, the system allows submitting comments and attachments within closed Cases.
## Prerequisites

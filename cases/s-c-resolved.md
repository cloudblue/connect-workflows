# Resolved Status
## Description
Once the reported issue is fixed, the system allows Partners to assign the *Resolved* status to their pending Case. Therefore, Partners can manually close their resolved cases. Otherwise, the system closes resolved Cases automatically depending on the specified **Autoclose Timeout** setting.
Note, however, that Partners can reopen their resolved Cases in case further issue investigation is required. Thus, the system transfers resolved Cases back to the *Pending* state.
## Prerequisites
Helpdesk Cases with the [Pending](s-a-pending.html) status.
## Transferable statuses
The system or Partners can transfer resolved Cases to the [Closed](s-d-closed.html) state.
Partners can also reopen their resolved Case and assign the [Pending](s-a-pending.html) status to this Case.

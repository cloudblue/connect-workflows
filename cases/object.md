# Helpdesk Cases
## Description
Helpdesk Cases represent support tickets or issues that are submitted in regard to a specific product or any other business/technical problem. Therefore, Cases provide an efficient and systemized communication model that allows Partners to quickly resolve various questions or requests on the CloudBlue Connect platform.
Once a new Case is created, the system assigns the *Pending* status to this Case. If more information or details are required, assigned agents can inquire certain data from Case reporters. 
Therefore, the system assigns the *Inquiring* status to this Case. Partners can also transfer the case back to the *Pending* state if all required information is presented.
Partners can also assign the *Resolved* status to their pending Case if necessary. Thus, this Case will be resolved and the system automatically assigns the *Closed* status to it (depending on your specified [Autoclose Timeout](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/account/single-sign-on/azure-active-directory/) setting within the **Account** module). 
Note that the system also allows closing resolved Cases manually or reopen resolved Cased and transfer them back to the *Pending* state.

# Subscription Suspension
## Description
This transition indicates that a suspend request was created and approved. Therefore, the system suspends an activated subscription and assigns *Suspended* status to it. In case a created suspend request is rejected by a Vendor, this subscription stays in the *Active* state.
Note that suspend requests are available in case the **Administrative Hold** capability is enabled. Refer to the [Connect community portal](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/products/capabilities/) to learn more about capability attributes.
## Prerequisites
A subscription with the [Active](s-b-active.html) status.
## Operation results

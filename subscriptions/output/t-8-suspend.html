<h1>Subscription Suspension</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This transition indicates that a suspend request was created and approved. Therefore, the system suspends an activated subscription and assigns <em>Suspended</em> status to it. In case a created suspend request is rejected by a Vendor, this subscription stays in the <em>Active</em> state.
Note that suspend requests are available in case the <strong>Administrative Hold</strong> capability is enabled. Refer to the <a href="https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/products/capabilities/">Connect community portal</a> to learn more about capability attributes.</p>

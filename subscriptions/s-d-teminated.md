# Terminated Status

Terminated subscription status can also indicate that a Vendor approved a cancel request. Buyers create such requests in case they want to cancel their subscription. Furthermore, cancel requests could be created from the Distributor or Vendor portals.
Note that the *Terminated* status represents a terminal state. No further actions with this subscriptions are required or available.

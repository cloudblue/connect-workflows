# Subscriptions
## Overview
A subscription on the Connect platform is an object that represents what your customers actually purchased (e.g., physical goods) or subscribed to (e.g., software as a service licenses). Moreover, subscriptions store product activation data and inquired information that can be specified during the *Ordering* phase or *Fulfillment* phase. Provided subscription data is interconnected with the provided product configuration and fulfillment requests on the Connect platform. Thus, for instance, an approved purchase fulfillment request activates a subscription, while an approved cancel request terminates a subscription.
Note that subscriptions can also be used for billing consolidation operations. Therefore, this provides business partners with a systematic way to consolidate billing data for each product arrangement.

# Subscriptions
## Overview
A subscription on the Connect platform is an object that represents what your customers actually purchased (e.g., physical goods) or subscribed to (e.g., software as a service licenses). Moreover, subscriptions store product activation data and inquired information that can be specified during the Ordering phase or Fulfillment phase. Provided subscription data is interconnected with the provided product configuration and fulfillment requests on the Connect platform. Thus, for instance, a purchase fulfillment request creates a subscription, while a cancel request terminates it.
Note that subscriptions can also be used for billing consolidation operations. Therefore, this provides business partners with a systematic way to consolidate billing data for each product arrangement.

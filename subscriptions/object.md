# Subscriptions
## Overview
Subscriptions represent instances of a product that are provisioned for customers. Subscriptions contain various purchase or product data, such as purchased items of a specified product, originators of this subscription, reseller information, product parameters, and other information.
Subscriptions are interconnected with *Fulfillment requests* (also called *Subscription requests*). Thus, for instance, a purchase fulfillment request create a subscription, while a cancel request terminate it. However, **Fulfillment requests should not be confused with Subscriptions** as they represent different objects within the Connect platform.

# Change/ Adjustment Request Creation
## Description
The system allows creating change or adjustment requests for your *active* subscriptions. Such requests allows updating subscription information and consolidating it with your business partner. Once a change or adjustment request is created for your subscription, it remains in the *Active* state whether such requests are processed or ignored.
While change and adjustment requests are similar in the context of the subscription workflow, each of them provide different functionality within the system.  
**Change** requests are generated in case the buyer changed purchased items or item quantity. Therefore, the system enable Vendors to approve this request and consequently change the subscription data. In case change requests are ignored or rejected, the system will not update subscription data.  
**Adjustment** requests help Vendors update fulfillment or ordering parameter values for subscriptions and update the associated *Activation Template*. Vendors can also approve such requests to successfully update subscription data or reject them to revert changes. Note that the system enables Vendors to immediately approve adjustment requests by using the corresponding option. 
## Prerequisites
A subscription with the [Active](s-b-active.html) status.
## Operation results
A submitted Change/Adjustment request to update an activated subscription.

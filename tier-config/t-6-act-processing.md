# Tier Configuration Update
## Description
Vendors or Distributors can update an active tier configuration instance on the Connect platform. In this case, the system generates an update tier request and transfers this active tier configuration to the *Processing* state. Therefore, Vendors are required to approve or reject this generated update tier request.
## Prerequisites
A tier configuration with the [Active](s-c-active.html) status.
## Operation results
A tier config in the [Processing](s-b-processing.html) state.

# Active Status 
## Description
In case Distributors activate a syndication contract, the system assigns the *Active* status to this contract. 
Active syndication contracts allow Resellers to start working with their selected products on the CloudBlue Connect platform. This include generating subscriptions, fulfillment requests, usage report files, and more. Refer to the [Connect community page](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/getting-started/reseller-tutorial/subscriptions/) for more details.
## Prerequisites
A syndication contract with the [Pending](s-a-pending.html) status.
## Transferable statuses
Once a Distributor terminates an active syndication contract, the system assigns the [Terminated](s-d-terminated.html) status to this contract.

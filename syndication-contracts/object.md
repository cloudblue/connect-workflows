# Syndication Contracts
## Overview
Resellers enroll their Syndication Contracts to collaborate with Distributors on the CloudBlue Connect platform. The system requires Distributors to create a Syndication Agreement that serves as the template for these contracts. Otherwise, Resellers cannot enroll syndication contracts.
Once Resellers enroll a new syndication contract, the system transfers this contract to the *Pending* state until it is signed and *activated* by their Distributors. Note that Distributors can also terminate active contracts after its activation. Connect stores *terminated* contracts and allows reviewing the deleted contract data.

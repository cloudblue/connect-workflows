# Contract Enrollment
## Description
This transition indicates that a Vendor enrolls a distribution agreement that is created by Distributors. Therefore, the system generates a new distribution contract and assigns the *Enroplling* status to this contract.
In case Distributors attach a **custom form** to the distribution agreement, Vendors should complete this form and provide all required information to successfully enroll their agreement and their contract.
## Prerequisites
A distribution agreement that is created by Distributors and enrolled by Vendors.
## Operation results
A distribution contract with the [Enrolling](s-a-enrolling.html) status.

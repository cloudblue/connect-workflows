# Data Refinement
## Description
This transition indicates that Distributors clicked the **Refine Data** button from a pending distribution contract. Thus, Distributiors ask Vendor to complete an attached **custom form** once again. Thereafter, the system will transfer this pending distribution contract back to the *Enrolling* state. Note that this transition is available in case a **custom form** is attached to a distribution agreement. Refer to the [Connect community page](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/forms/) to learn more about costom forms.
## Prerequisites
A distribution contract with the [Pending](s-b-enrolled.html) status.
## Operation results
A distribution contract with the [Enrolling](s-a-enrolled.html) status.

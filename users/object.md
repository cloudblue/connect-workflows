# User Objects
## Description
Users represent employees and team members at your organization, such as IT specialists, managers, and sales representatives, who can access the CloudBlue Connect platform. 
Once a new user is added to the Connect platform, the system generates a user object and assigns the *Invited* status to this object. In case your invited user successfully activates the provided invitation, the system transfers this object to the *Joined* state. Otherwise, the invitation can be revoked and thus the user object can be assigned to the *Expired* status. Note, however, that the system allows resending invitations and transferring expired user objects back to the *Invited* state.

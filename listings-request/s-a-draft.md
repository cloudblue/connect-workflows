# Draft Request Status
## Description
The Draft listing request status indicates that this listing request is not complete and not submitted to Distributors/ Resellers for a review.

Once Vendors provide all required data, the system automatically assigns the *Reviewing* status to the listing request. Otherwise, Vendors can cancel their listing request creation and this draft is deleted.  
## Prerequisites
A published product and an active distribution contract are required to create a listing request.
## Transferable statuses
Once a Vendor submits a listing request to a Provider, this draft listing request is assigned to the [Reviewing](s-b-reviewing.html) status.

# Listing Requests
## Overview
A listing request represents a Vendorâ€™s formal request to list a product on a specified marketplace. Listing requests contain product specifications, associated price lists, and included product offers. These requests are initiated by Vendors and sent to Distributors. Thereafter, Distributors can complete listing requests or reject them. Listing requests are interconnected with Listings and these requests are stored within the Listigns module. However, **listing requests should not be confused with listings** as they represent different objects within the Connect platform.

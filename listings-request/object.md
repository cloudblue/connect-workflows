# Listing Requests
## Overview
A *listing request* object represents a formal request to list a product on a specified marketplace. Listing requests contain product specifications, associated price lists, and included product offers. 
The system allows Vendors to generate listing requests of the following types: *create* (requests to list a new product), *update* (requests to update listing data), or delete (requests to delist a product from the marketplace). Consequently, all listing requests should be processed by Distributors/ Resellers.

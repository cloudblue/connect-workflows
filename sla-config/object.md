# SLA Settings
## Description
SLA settings represent an object on the CloudBlue Connect platform that contains your provided Service Level Management configurations. This includes SLO zones transition settings for each Connect object that is associated with the SLM functionality (e.g., tier config requests and susbcription requests). SLA settings also include configurations that enables the automatic rejection of associated objects.  

By default, SLA settings are disabled for each applicable object. Once SLA settings are enabled, the system will assign associated object to the corresponding SLO zones and will use Service Level Indicators to display applicable zone for each object. Note that SLA settings can be disabled again and can also be restored to the default configuration.

# Schedule Reactivation
## Description
Once Connect users decide to reactivate their disabled report schedule objects, the system transfers such objects back to the *Enabled* state. Therefore, the Connect platform will start generating required report files based on your specified triggers and selected report template.
## Prerequisites
A report schedule in the [Disabled](s-b-disabled.html) state.
## Operation results
A report schedule with the [Enabled](s-a-enabled.html) status.

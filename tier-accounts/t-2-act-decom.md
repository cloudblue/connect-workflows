# Tier Account Removal
## Description
This transition implies that your customer or reseller account is removed. Thus, the Connect platform assigns the *Decommissioned* status to your tier account object. Namely, removed tier account objects in this state cannot be used to generate subscriptions and fullfillment request on Connect. In addition, note that removed tier account objects cannot be restored.
## Prerequisites
A tier account object with the [Active](s-a-active.html) status.
## Operation results
A tier account object in the [Decommissioned](s-b-decom.html) state.

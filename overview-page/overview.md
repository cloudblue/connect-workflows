# Workflow Explorer
## Overview
The majority of modules that are available on the CloudBlue Connect platform include objects with distinctive and non-trivial workflows. Understanding such workflows can be essential for various business scenarios. For example, to successfully process fulfillment requests, it is required to get familiar with the workflow of such objects. Furthermore, in case your fulfillment request requires to complete tier configuration, it is also necessary to familiarize yourself with the workflow of tier configuration request first. 

Workflow Explorer is designed to help Connect users quickly and efficiently grasp the workflow concepts throughout all modules. It also provides detailed description of all available object statuses and outlines conditions for object transitions from one status to another. Workflow Explorer consists of diagrams that schematically illustrate workflows of all applicable objects on the platform. Thus, these diagrams allow Connect users to visualize and learn about each status and transition.

Once you select an object that includes the workflow explorer diagram and documentation,  the interface allows navigating between objects statuses and learn more about the object's workflow. Hover your cursor over available status icons or transitions to highlight them. Click on a status icon to display detailed information on your selected state, available operations, associated transitions and more. 

Note that it is also possible to click on a transition to access its description, prerequisites, and other information.

# Closed Status 
## Description
The *Closed* status showcases that Distributors or Resellers successfully provided **external billing id** and **external billing note** for all specified usage records. Therefore, this status indicates that all transitions are successful and all billing operations are accomplished.

No further transitions are available for closed usage file objects. Note, however, that the system allows changing **external billing id** and **external billing note** data for usage files with the *Closed* status.
## Prerequisites
A usage file object in the [Accepted](s-h-accepted.html) state.
## Associated transitions

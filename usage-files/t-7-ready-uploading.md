# Processed File Reuploading
## Description
This transition indicates that Vendors decided to reupload their usage file in the *Ready* state. This functionality can be especially helpful in case the processed file contains any errors or reported data is outdated. Note that in this case the system also assigns the usage file object back the *Uploading* status.
## Prerequisites
A usage file object in the [Ready](s-e-ready.html) state.
## Operation results
A usage file object with the [Uploading](s-b-uploading.html) status.

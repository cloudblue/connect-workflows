# Usage File Processing
## Description
Once Vendors successfully upload their usage report file to the Connect platform, the system starts to automatcially process the provided spreadsheet file. Therefore, this transition represents the processing of the uploaded usage file. Note that in this case the system assigns the [Processing](s-c-processing.html) status to the usage file object.
## Prerequisites
A usage file object in the [Uploading](s-b-uploading.html) state.
## Operation results
A usage file object with the [Processing](s-c-processing.html) status.

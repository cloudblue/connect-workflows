# Published Status
## Description
Once Vendors create a new product version with a *draft* item, the system assigns the *Published* status to this item. Therefore, your customers can purchase published items and consequently create subscriptions on the Connect platform. 
Vendors can transfer their published items to the *End of Sale* state in case their specified item is no longer available. However, Vendors can also restore the *Published* status to such items if necessary.
Note that Vendors cannot delete published items. Furthermore, Vendors can edit only general item attributes, such as a name, description, MPN, and parent item.
## Prerequisites
An item in the [Draft](s-a-draft.html) state and a saved product version required.
## Transferable statuses
Vendors can assign the [End of Sale](s-c-endsale.html) status to their published items.

# Translation Deactivation
## Description
The transition implies that your translation object is being deactivated within the system. Thus, this translation will be automatically assigned to the *Inactive* state and it will not be applied to the selected context once again. Note that the system also allows reactivating disabled translations.
## Prerequisites
A translation object in the [Active](s-b-active.html) state.
## Operation results
A translation object with the [Inactive](s-a-inactive.html) status.

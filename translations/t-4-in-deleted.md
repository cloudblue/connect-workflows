# Translation Removal
## Description
This transition implies that your translation is being removed. Removed translation objects or your provided translation values for associated context keys cannot be restored. 
Note that the system does not allow removing your primary translations. Thus, it is required to assign another translation as your primary translation for your selected context.
## Prerequisites
A translation object in the [Inactive](s-a-inactive.html) state.
## Operation results
A deleted translation object.

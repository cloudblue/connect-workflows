# Inactive Status
## Description
The *Inactive* status indicates that your translation is deactivated and it cannot be applied to your selected context. Specifically, inactive translations will not be available for your business partners or customers.  Note, however, that inactive translations can be previewed within the system and can be selected as your primary translations for your context.
The system allows editing your inactive translations, cloning such objects, and comparing them with active or inactive translations. Inactive translations can also removed if necessary.
## Prerequisites 
A new created translation on the Connect platform.  
Alternatively, a translation object in the [Active](s-b-active.html) state that should be deactivated.
## Transferable statuses
Once your translation is successfully activated, it is assigned to the [Active](s-b-active.html) state.

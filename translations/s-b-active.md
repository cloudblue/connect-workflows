# Active Status
## Description
The *Active* status implies that your translation is activated successfully. Therefore, your translation will be available for your business partners or customers. Your business partners will also be able to generate additional translation objects based on your translation within the system. 
Your active translation can be assigned as the primary translation for your context.  
The system also enables to edit your active translations, to clone active translation objects, and to compare them with other active or inactive translations.
Note that active translations cannot be removed.
## Prerequisites 
A translation object in the [Inactive](s-a-inactive.html) state that should be activated.
## Transferable statuses
In case your translation is deactivated, the system assigns it to the [Inactive](s-a-inactive.html) state.

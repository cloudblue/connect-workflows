# Domain Objects
## Description
Adding and verifying your domain is required to successfully implement the Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality on the CloudBlue Connect platform. This functionality represents a centralized session and user authentication scheme in which same credentials can be used to login into the CloudBlue Connect platform along with other services and systems. Therefore, SSO reduces password fatigue and drastically improves security across organizations.

Domain objects contain your added domain name and data that is essential for your domain verification within the system. Once your domain is verified successfully, all SSO features will be available for your organization. In case of an error, the system displays corresponding messages and assigns the corresponding status to the domain object.
Domain objects also allow managing authorization modes, exclusion lists, and other configurations for the SSO functionality.

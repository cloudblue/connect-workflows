# Verification Failure
## Description
This transition implies that your domain verification is failed due to the DNS record error. In this case, it is required to make sure that your required records are valid and added to your DNS configuration.
Additionally, note that DNS changes can generally take a while to be applied. Thus, it is recommended to wait a few hours, reopen your domain and try to verify it again.  
## Prerequisites
A domain object in the [Verifying](s-a-verifying.html) state.
## Operation results
A domain object with the [Verification Failed](s-d-failed.html) status.

# Domain Reverification
## Description
This transition indicates that your domain verification is failed and it is required to relaunch the verification process. Therefore, the system will transfer your domain object back to the *Verifying* state and will also try to verify your domain once again.
## Prerequisites
A domain object with the [Verification Failed](s-d-failed.html) status.
## Operation results
A domain object in the [Verifying](s-a-verifying.html) state.

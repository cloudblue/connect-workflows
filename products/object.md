# Products
## Overview
Products represent substances, software or services that are provisioned, fulfilled, or
manufactured by Vendors. Thus, Vendors configure their products and define all required product data via the **Products** module on the Connect platform. Product data include items (SKUs), product overview, provided media, and so on. Furthermore, Vendors can provide different versions of a product and send requests to list or delist these product versions on specified marketplaces. 
Once Vendors assign a version to a *Draft* product, it transfers to the *Published* state. Vendors can also delete a product or assign it with the *End of sale* status. The following provide detailed information about each product status and product transition on the CloudBlue Connect platform.

## Additional Information

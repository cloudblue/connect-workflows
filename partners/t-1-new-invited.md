# Partner Invitation
## Description
This transition indicates that a new partner object and an invitation link are generated on the CloudBlue Connect platform. Note that the system assigns the *Invited* status to this object. Thus, it is necessary to provide your partner with the invitation link so that this partner can complete the registration and activate the Connect account.
## Prerequisites
Generating an invitation link for your partners requires you to create a program contract or a service contract first. Note that the system helps defining required agreements and contracts via the partner creation wizard.
## Operation results
A new partner object with the [Invited](s-a-invited.html) status and a new generated invitation link.

# Invited Status
## Description
The system assigns the *Invited* status to a new created partner object on the CloudBlue Connect platform. Therefore, the system generates an invitation link and requires you to provide your partner with this link. The invitation link will help your partners successfully activate their account on Connect.
## Prerequisites
Generating an invitation link for your partners requires you to create a program contract or a service contract first. Note that the system helps defining required agreements and contracts via the partner creation wizard.
## Transferable statuses
Once your partner successfully activates the invitation link and their Connect account, the system assigns corresponding partner account to the [Active](s-b-active.html) state.

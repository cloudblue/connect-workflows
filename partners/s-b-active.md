# Active Status
## Description
Once your partners activated their invitation link and successfully registered their account on the CloudBlue Connect platform, the system transfers the corresponding partner object to the *Active* state.
The system also assigns this status in case you selected to create and activate the partner account instantly. Therefore, the system allows adding a representative of this account via the partner creation wizard or after the account is successfully crerated (by using the [Account module](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/account/users/)). The addedd representative can invite required users to this account and consequently start collaborating with your organization on Connect.

## Prerequisites
A partner account in the [Invited](s-a-invited.html) state.
Alternatively, a partner account can be instantly created and activated by using the partner creation wizard.
## Further operations
In case program or service contracts of your partners are terminated, the system removes such accounts from your partner list.

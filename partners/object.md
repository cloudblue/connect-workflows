# Partners
## Description
Partner objects, as the name implies, represent your partner Distributor, Reseller, or Vendor accounts on the CloudBlue Connect platform. The system allows inviting your partners to the platform via invitiation links. 
In case an invitation link is generated, the system creates a new partner object and assigns the *Invtited* status to this object. Once your partners access the link and activate their Connect account, the system transfers the object to the *Active* state.
Alternatively, you can instantly create and activate your partner account on the Connect platform. 
Note that the system also allows terminating contracts with your partners. In this case, your partner account will be *removed* from your partner list.

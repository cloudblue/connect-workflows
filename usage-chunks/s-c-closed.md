# Closed Status 
## Description
The system assigns the *Closed* status to your usage file chunk object once an external identifier and external note are provided for this object. Therefore, this status generally indicates that all billing operations that are associated with the usage file chunk are finalized.

Note that the system allows downloading usage record information if your usage file chunk object is assigned to this state. Moreover, the system allows changing external identifiers for your closed usage file chunks.
## Prerequisites
A usage file chunk object in the [Ready](s-b-ready.html) state.
## Associated transition
[Usage File Chunk Closure](t-3-ready-closed.html)

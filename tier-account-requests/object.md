# Tier Account Requests
## Overview
Tier Account Requests represent objects that store changes to the customer and reseller account object attributes. A tier account request is generated in case tier account information is edited. These request enable Distributors to consolidate tier account data with Vendors. Therefore, Partners can keep track of all tier account changes and updates.
In case the **Tier Accounts Sync** capability is disabled, your generated tier account request is automatically transferred to the *Unsupported* state. Once this capability is switched on, a new created pending request is assigned to the *Pending* status until it is accepted or ignored by Vendor.

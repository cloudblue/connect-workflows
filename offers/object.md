# Offers
## Description
Offers represents logical grouping of one or multiple product plans. Plans are service levels that provide different item quantity, product features, etc. For example, a product can have an offer *for home* and another offer *for business* with basic, standard, and premium plans. Furthermore, different plans usually provide different features and groups of features.
Once Vendors generate a new offer instance, the system assigns the *Private* status to this offer. Vendors are required to define their offer and save its public version to transfer it to the *Ready* state. In case Vendors add their offer to their listing request, the system assigns *Listed* state to this offer.
The following provides more information on available offer statuses and transitions on the CloudBlue Connect platform.

# Listings
## Overview
Once Vendors decide to list their product to their selected marketplace, the system automatically generates a Listing object that includes the defined product, selected distributor, marketplace, specified price list and offer. Listing objects are used to indicate whether a defined product is available for sale within the specified marketplace.
Listing objects are managed via Listing Requests. Namely, these requests are used to list the specified product to the required marketplace, update the listing information, or remove the product from this marketplace. Therefore, Vendors generate a listing request in case it is required to create, update or delete listings.
Distributors or Resellers can approve or reject listing request and consequently manage listing objects on the Connect platform.

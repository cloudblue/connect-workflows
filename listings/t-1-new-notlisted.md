# Listing Creation
## Description
This transition indicates that a Vendor submits a new listing request and the system generates a new listing. In case Distributors deploy a product and mark this listing request as *Completed*, the system assigns the **Listed** status to the listing. Otherwise, Distributors reject the request and the listing will remain in the **Not Listed** state. 
## Prerequisites
A submitted listing request is required for the system to create a new listing with this status.
## Operation results
A listing with the [Not Listed](s-a-notlisted.html) status.

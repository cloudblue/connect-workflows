In case Distributors deploy a product and mark this listing request as <em>Completed</em>, the system assigns the <strong>Listed</strong> status to the listing. Otherwise, Distributors reject the request and the listing will remain in the <strong>Not Listed</strong> state. </p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>A submitted listing request is required for the system to create a new listing with this status.</p>
<h2>Operation results</h2>
<p>A listing with the <a href="s-a-notlisted.html">Not Listed</a> status.</p>

# New Inactive Agreement Version Creation
## Description
This transition implies that Distributors decided to create a new agreement object. However, the **Activate Version** checkbox was left unchecked. Therefore, the system generates a new agreement version object and assigns the *Inactive* status to this object. This agreement version cannot be used to generate contracts on the Connect platform. Note that the system also allows Distributors to activate such objects manually.
## Prerequisites
A new created agreement with uhchecked **Activate Version** checkbox required.
## Operation results
An new agreement version with the [Inactive](s-b-inactive.html) status.

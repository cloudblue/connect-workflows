# Active Agreement Version Removal
## Description
The Connect platform enables Distributors to delete active agreement versions. However, that system doesn't allow removing active agreement versions in case at least one associated contract exist. In addition, the system doesn't allow removing the last version object in your agreement. Note that removed agreement version objects cannot be restored.
## Prerequisites
An agreement version object in the [Active](s-a-active.html) state.
## Operation results
A removed agreement version.

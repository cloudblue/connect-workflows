# Agreement Version Reactivation
## Description
The CloudBlue Connect platform allows Distributors to reactivate inactive agreement versions. Once Distributors reactivate their inactive agreement object, the system automatically transfers this object back to the *Active* state. Therefore, this agreement version can be used to generate contracts on the platform.
## Prerequisites
An agreement version with the [Inactive](s-b-inactive.html) status.
## Operation results
An agreement version object in the [Active](s-a-active.html) state.

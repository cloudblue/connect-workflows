# Agreement Version Deactivation
## Description
Once you decide to activate another agreement version, the system automatically deactivates your actual agreement version. The system also notifies your business partners about a new agreement version. In addition, note your deactivated version cannot be used to generate contracts on Connect. Therefore, this transition implies that the system deactivates your agreement version.
## Prerequisites
An agreement version object in the [Active](s-a-active.html) state.
## Operation results
An agreement version with the [Inactive](s-b-inactive.html) status.

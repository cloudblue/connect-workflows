# Inactive Status
## Description
In case Distributors create a new agreement and uncheck the **Activate Version** checkbox, the system generates a new agreement version object and transfers it to the *Inctive* state. Furthermore, the system enables Distributors to deactivate agreement versions that are assigned to the *Active* status. Note, however, that the system requires Distributors to create another agreement version and activate it. Thus, the system automatically deactivates the active version object and actives another object.
The *Inactive* status implies that the system does not use the agreement version (i.e., your document version) as a template for your contracts. Inactive agreement versions can also be reactivated again and assigned back to the *Active* status.
## Prerequisites
A new created agreement with unchecked **Activate Version** checkbox required. Alternatively, another version object is required to transfer your existing agreement version with the [Active](s-a-active.html) status.
## Transferable statuses
Once your agreement version object is reactivated, the system transfers this object back to the [Active](s-a-active.html) state.

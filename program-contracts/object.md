# Program Contracts
## Overview
Distributors and Vendors sign their program contracts to set business partnerships through the CloudBlue Connect platform. Before creating a program contract, a Distributor must ensure that an associated program agreement is created. Alternatively, Distributors can generate program agreement and program contracts while creating a Vendor-type Partner account.
Once a new program contract is created by a Distributor, the system trasnfers this contract to the *Pending* state until it is signed and *activated* by a Vendor.
Note Distributors can delete a pending program contract. Therefore, the system removes the deleted contract from the database. Distributors can also terminate active contracts. In contrast, Connect stores *terminated* contracts and enables users to view the contract data.

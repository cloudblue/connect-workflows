# Active Status 
## Description
Once a Vendor signes a program contract, the system assigns the *Active* status to this contract. 
Note that Distributors can terminate active program contracts and transfer them to the corresponding state.
Active program contracts allow Vendors to activate the Vendor Portal and address the functionality of the CloudBlue Connect platform. Refer to the [Connect community page](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/partners/contracts/program-contracts/#Vendor_Portal) for more details.
## Prerequisites
A program contract with the [Pending](s-a-pending.html) status.
## Transferable statuses
Once a Distributor terminates an active program contract, the system assigns the [Terminated](s-d-terminated.html) status to this contract.

# Schedule Delayed Activation
## Description
This transition indicates that Vendors define a waiting period before processing fulfillment requests. This allows organizations to synchronize their workflows and make all required preparations before processing their subscription. Therefore, the Connect platform assigns the Scheduled status once Vendors successfully assigned time and date for delayed activation.
## Prerequisites
A fulfillment request with [Pending](s-b-pending.html) status.
## Operation results
A request with the [Scheduled](s-g-scheduled.html) status.

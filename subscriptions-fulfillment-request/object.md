# Subscriptions / Fulfillment Requests
## Description
Fulfillment requests (or Subscription requests) represent product orders that are originated from Providerâ€™s commerce systemd and sent to Vendors. To process fulfillment requests, Vendors require information not only relative to their product, but also about the customer, supply chain, marketplaces, etc. Therefore, the Connect platform stores and provides all required data to process fullfillment requests.
Fulfillment requests are interconnected with Subscriptions, and these requests are stored within the Subscriptions module. Thus, for instance, a purchase request create a subscription, while a cancel request terminate it. However, **Fulfillment requests should not be confused with Subscriptions** as they represent different objects within the Connect platform.

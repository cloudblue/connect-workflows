# Approved Request Status
## Description
Once Vendors successfully approve a processing fulfillment request, the system assigns the Approved to this request. Therefore, the system performs requested operations with your subscription object depending on your request type. For example, in case a purchase request is approved, the system activates your subscription object. However, once a cancel request is approved, the system terminates your subscription.
Approved requests on the CloudBlue Connect platform ensure that only correct and relevant information is processed. Further actions with active requests are not required.
## Prerequisites
A fulfillment request with the [Pending](s-b-pending.html) status.
## Associated transition

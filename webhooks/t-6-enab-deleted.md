# Disabled Webhook Removal
## Description
This transition implies that your enabled webhook is being deleted. Removed webhooks objects cannot be used or restored. Thus, in case your webhook functionality is required once again, it is necessary to create and configure a new webhook object within the system.
## Prerequisites
A webhook object with the [Enabled](s-b-enabled.html) status.
## Operation results
A deleted webhook object.

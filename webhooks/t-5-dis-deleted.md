# Disabled Webhook Removal
## Description
This transition implies that your disabled webhook is being removed. Note that removed webhooks objects cannot be restored. Thus, in case your webhook functionality is required again, it is necessary to create and configure a new webhook object on the platform.
## Prerequisites
A webhook object in the [Disabled](s-a-disabled.html) state.
## Operation results
A deleted webhook object.

# New Draft Creation
## Description
This transition indicates that the system generates a new *draft* request. Thereafter, this draft can be successfully validated and assigned to the *Pending* status. In case parameter value should be specified, the system assigns the request to the *Inquiring* status. Furthermore, in case Tier 2-level request is created, the Connect platform assigns the draft to the *Tiers Setup* state. Otherwise, the draft is permanently deleted.
## Prerequisites
The enabled **Dynamic Validation – Tier Config Request – Draft** product capability is required.
## Operation results
A new tier configuration request with the [Draft](s-a-draft.html) status is created as a result of this operation.

# Approved Status
## Description
Once Vendors approve a pending tier request, the Connect platform assigns the *Approved* status to this request. Therefore, its associated tier configuration will be successfully activated by the system. In addition, its interconnected fulfillment request is assigned to the *Pending* state and can be processed by Vendors.
Note that the *Approved* status represents a terminal state, meaning no actions with approved requests are available or required.
## Prerequisites
A tier request with the [Pending](s-b-pending.html) status.

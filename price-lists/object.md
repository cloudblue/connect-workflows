# Price Lists
## Overview
The CloudBlue Connect platform allows establishing and automating the cost-effective process of the price lists exchange from Vendors to Distributors. Note that creating a price list is an optional part of the product definition flow. 
Vendors can generate price list drafts by using the Connect platform. Thereafter, Vendors can activate created drafts or delete them if necessary.
Furthermore, the system enables Vendors to schedule price list activation. Thus, created draft list can be activated on specified time. Vendors are also able to unschedule price lists and transfer them back to *Draft* state.
Note that in case the activated price list is no longer relevant, Vendors can terminate these lists.
